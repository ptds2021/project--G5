## Goals and impacts

An anime is a hand-drawn or computer animation originated from Japan. 
Anime describes all animated work, regardless of the style or origin. 
The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, and Toei Animation. 
As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world’s animated television shows.
The goal of our project would be to recommend anime to someone who would like to watch it according to certain criteria that he will give us.
This could save time for the viewers while offering them an anime in line with their expectations. 


## Plan

Our inspiration for this project came from two sources. 
The first was a presentation by a group from previous years that made recommendations for films. 
The second is that two people in our group have already worked on an anime database in a Machine Learning course. 
We decided that it would be interesting to exploit this data in a deeper way by creating an interactive platform with a Shiny app.


The data set that we are going to use is sourced from Kaggle [Anime dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020?select=watching_status.csv). 
It contains information about 17'562 anime and the preference of 325'772 different users.

For the moment we think that we will need to keep the following variables: 

- `MAL_ID`: Id of the anime

- `Name`: Name of the anime

- `Genders`: Genre of the anime

- `Type`: Types of anime (TV, movie...)

- `Episodes`: Number of chapters

- `Producers`: Producer of the anime

- `Studios`: Studios

- `Source`: Sources of anime (Manga, Light novel, Book...)

- `Duration`: Duration of the anime per episode

- `Rating`: Age rate of the anime:
  - `PG-13`: for teens 13 or older 
  - `G`: All Ages 
  - `PG`: Children 
  - `Rx`: Hentai 
  - `R`: 17+ (violence & profanity) 
  - `R+`: Mild Nudity

The goal of our project is to make the user of our application fill in a certain number of boxes in order to offer him the best anime recommendation: 
We can ask him which producer, studio, source, genre and type of anime he prefers. 
We can also ask him to give us some indications about the time he has to watch it (recommendation based on the number of episodes and their duration). 
Finally, with their age, we can also better target our recommendation thanks to the `Rating` variable. 



## Timeline and milestones

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("giocomai/ganttrify")


# Create variables

activity <- c('Project Proposal', 'Create shiny app with our variables of interest', 
              'Update and/or add new things', 
              'Finalization, make the app easy to read and prepare final presentation',
              'Final presentation')
start_date <- c(01.11, 07.11 , 24.11, 08.12, 15.12)
end_date <- c(07.11, 24.11, 08.12, 15.12, 20.12)
# Creation of a data frame
organisation_G5 <- data.frame(activity, start_date, end_date)

ganttrify(project = organisation_G5,
          hide_wp = TRUE,
          project_start_date = "2021-11",
          font_family = "Roboto Condensed")
```

describe the timeline of your project and indicate key intermediary goals in a Gantt chart (see this package for example).


## Management plan

explain how you plan to collaborate (weekly meeting on Zoom, …) and indicate responsabilities (each member of the team should be at least responsible for one part of the project).
